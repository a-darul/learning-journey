My node is running well at my local.

When I sent it to development server
It works fine with **GET** method
but when doing a **POST** method request

we got error
> <html>\r\n<head><title>301 Moved Permanently</title></head>\r\n<body>\r\n<center><h1>301 Moved Permanently</h1></center>\r\n<hr><center>nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)</center>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n


So the solution is checking your URL
- 
- Use HTPPS on your request protocol
